# Description

This repo contains my attempts to dive into the world of Custom Views.

## Motivation

Love to exploration ~~and deep depression~~.

## Materials

_Awesome book_: [Building Android UIs with Custom Views](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-android-uis-custom-views?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785882869).  
[Ready to use samples](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Android-UIs-with-Custom-Views) related to the awesome book.

# Rules of repo

## Main conventions of this repo
- All custom views are implemented using `Java`.
- Code related to usage of views is written in `Kotlin`.

_That's why sometimes usage of views may look not that cool and comfortable. Simple example: Instantiating view via `Builder` pattern._
